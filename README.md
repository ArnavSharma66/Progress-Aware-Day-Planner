# Progress-Aware-Day-Planner
Minimal productivity app: set daily targets, log time
Progress-Aware Day Planner is a lightweight React + Vite app that helps you plan and track daily work by category. Set daily target hours per category, add tasks or quick manual time entries, run the built-in timer and save sessions to categories. The UI shows a colour-coded status (green/yellow/red) indicating whether you have enough time left in your day to complete your workload.
