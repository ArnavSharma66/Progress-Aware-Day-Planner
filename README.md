# Progress-Aware Day Planner ⏰✅

A lightweight, browser-based productivity app built with **React + Vite** that helps you manage your day more effectively.  
Define your daily start time, set categories (like *Work* or *Study*), track tasks, and get live feedback on whether you can still finish everything in time.
